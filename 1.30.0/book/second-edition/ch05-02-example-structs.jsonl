{"question": "What is the purpose of the *rectangles* project?", "answer": "The *rectangles* project calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height in pixels."}
{"question": "What is the initial approach to calculating the area of a rectangle in the *rectangles* project?", "answer": "The initial approach uses separate variables for width and height, and passes them as arguments to the `area` function."}
{"question": "What is the issue with the initial approach of using separate variables for width and height?", "answer": "The width and height are related, but this relationship is not expressed in the code. The `area` function takes two parameters, which makes it less clear that it calculates the area of a single rectangle."}
{"question": "How does the code refactor the initial approach using tuples?", "answer": "The code uses a tuple to group the width and height together, passing a single argument to the `area` function."}
{"question": "What is the drawback of using tuples to represent the width and height of a rectangle?", "answer": "Tuples don't name their elements, making the code less clear and potentially confusing when accessing the width and height values using tuple indices."}
{"question": "What is the solution to the clarity issue with tuples?", "answer": "The code refactors the program using structs to add meaning by labeling the data. A `Rectangle` struct is defined with `width` and `height` fields, providing descriptive names for the values."}
{"question": "How does the `area` function work with the `Rectangle` struct?", "answer": "The `area` function takes an immutable borrow of a `Rectangle` instance as a parameter and accesses its `width` and `height` fields to calculate the area."}
{"question": "Why does the `area` function borrow the `Rectangle` instance instead of taking ownership?", "answer": "Borrowing allows the `main` function to retain ownership of the `rect1` instance and continue using it after calling the `area` function."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `Debug` trait?", "answer": "The `Debug` trait enables printing a struct in a developer-friendly format for debugging purposes."}
{"question": "Why does the compiler require the `#[derive(Debug)]` annotation for the `Rectangle` struct?", "answer": "Structs don't have a default implementation of the `Debug` trait, so we need to explicitly opt in to make it available."}
{"question": "What is the difference between using `{:?}` and `{:#?}` in the `println!` macro?", "answer": "Both `{:?}` and `{:#?}` use the `Debug` trait for formatting, but `{:#?}` provides a more readable output with indentation and line breaks for larger structs."}
{"question": "What is the next step in refactoring the code?", "answer": "The next step is to turn the `area` function into an `area` method defined on the `Rectangle` struct, tying the behavior more closely to the struct."}
