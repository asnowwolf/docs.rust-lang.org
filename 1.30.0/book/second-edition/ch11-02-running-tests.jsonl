{"question": "What should I be aware of when running tests in parallel?", "answer": "Make sure your tests don’t depend on each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment."}

{"question": "How can I see the output printed to standard output by passing tests?", "answer": "Use the `--nocapture` flag with the test binary."}
{"question": "How can I run a specific test by name?", "answer": "Pass the name of the test function to `cargo test` as an argument."}
