{"question": "What is the state pattern?", "answer": "The state pattern is an object-oriented design pattern where a value's behavior changes based on its internal state, represented by state objects."}
{"question": "How is the state pattern implemented in Rust?", "answer": "In Rust, structs and traits are used instead of objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible for its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another state."}
{"question": "What is the advantage of using the state pattern?", "answer": "Using the state pattern means that when the business requirements of the program change, you only need to update the code inside one of the state objects, not the code of the value holding the state or the code that uses the value."}
{"question": "What is the workflow of a blog post in the example?", "answer": "A blog post starts as an empty draft. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested. When the post is approved, it gets published. Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can't accidentally be published."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `Post` struct?", "answer": "The `Post` struct holds the content of a blog post and uses the state pattern to manage its state."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `State` trait?", "answer": "The `State` trait defines the behavior shared by different post states, such as draft, pending review, and published."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `Draft` struct?", "answer": "The `Draft` struct represents the initial state of a blog post, where it is an empty draft."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `add_text` method?", "answer": "The `add_text` method allows text to be added to the blog post's content while it is in the draft state."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `content` method?", "answer": "The `content` method returns the content of the blog post, but only if it is in the published state. Otherwise, it returns an empty string."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `request_review` method?", "answer": "The `request_review` method changes the state of the blog post from `Draft` to `PendingReview`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `PendingReview` struct?", "answer": "The `PendingReview` struct represents the state of a blog post that is waiting for a review."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `approve` method?", "answer": "The `approve` method changes the state of the blog post from `PendingReview` to `Published`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `Published` struct?", "answer": "The `Published` struct represents the state of a blog post that has been approved and published."}
{"question": "What are the trade-offs of using the state pattern?", "answer": "The state pattern is easy to extend and maintain, but it can lead to duplication of logic and coupling between states."}
{"question": "How can the state pattern be improved in Rust?", "answer": "By encoding states and behavior as types, Rust's type checking system can prevent attempts to use draft posts where only published posts are allowed."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `DraftPost` struct?", "answer": "The `DraftPost` struct represents a blog post in the draft state and does not have a `content` method, preventing accidental display of draft content."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `PendingReviewPost` struct?", "answer": "The `PendingReviewPost` struct represents a blog post in the pending review state and does not have a `content` method."}
{"question": "How are transitions between states implemented in this improved version?", "answer": "Transitions are implemented as transformations into different types. For example, calling `request_review` on a `DraftPost` returns a `PendingReviewPost`, and calling `approve` on a `PendingReviewPost` returns a `Post`."}
{"question": "What are the advantages of encoding states as types?", "answer": "Encoding states as types makes invalid states impossible and prevents certain bugs at compile time."}
{"question": "What is the conclusion of the chapter?", "answer": "Rust is capable of implementing object-oriented design patterns, but other patterns, such as encoding state into the type system, are also available and can provide benefits, such as preventing some bugs at compile time."}
